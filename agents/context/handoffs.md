### 2026-01-13 Orchestrator → All Agents

**Context**: neural-race-multiview paper imported from /Users/michaellaielli/workspace/kdmech into ai-lab framework. Project has substantial groundwork complete (3 theorems, experiment infrastructure, 11 experiments, paper draft v0.1) but faces critical theory-experiment mismatch blocker.

**Action needed**:
- All agents: Review papers/neural-race-multiview/README.md for project overview
- Orchestrator: Review TASK-001 and decide on resolution approach for BLOCKER-001
- Paper agent: Familiarize with PRD and research plan

**Files/Links**:
- papers/neural-race-multiview/README.md
- papers/neural-race-multiview/prd/paper_requirements.md
- agents/context/blockers.md (BLOCKER-001)
- agents/tasks/review/TASK-001-neural-race-multiview-resolve-theory-mismatch.md

### 2026-01-10 Engineer → Advisor (Historical)

**Context**: P1 experiments completed for neural-race-multiview. Critical finding: theory predictions don't match experiments. Expected winner-take-all (coverage ≈ 0.33), observed all-views-learned (coverage = 1.0).

**Action needed**: Decide on next steps for resolving theory-experiment mismatch
