# Priorities

Current focus areas for all agents.

## Active Priorities

1. **neural-race-multiview Theory Validation** — Resolve mismatch between predicted winner-take-all dynamics and observed all-views-learned behavior
2. **neural-race-multiview Next Steps Decision** — Review advisor's proposed approaches (loss modifications, metric changes, theoretical revisions) and decide path forward
3. **neural-race-multiview Paper Development** — Continue validation experiments and paper writing once theory is validated

## Guidelines

- Keep this list short (3-5 items max)
- Update when priorities change
- All agents should review before starting work
