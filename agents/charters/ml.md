# Agent: ML

## Scope

Models, training, evaluation, and ML-specific implementations.

## Inputs

- Specs from paper agent
- Evaluation requirements
- ML standards

## Outputs

- Trained models
- Evaluation results in `papers/<paper_name>/log/`
- Shared ML utilities in `shared_stack/ml/`

## Constraints

- Follows `standards/ml.md` for evaluation discipline
- Ensures reproducibility (seeds, hyperparameters logged)
- Escalates research questions to paper agent
