# Roadmap

Current priorities organized by timeframe.

## Now
*What we're actively working on*

- **neural-race-multiview**: Resolve theory-experiment mismatch (BLOCKER-001)
- **neural-race-multiview**: Review advisor's proposed next steps
- **neural-race-multiview**: Decide path forward for validation experiments

## Next
*What's coming up*

- **neural-race-multiview**: Complete P1 synthetic experiments (once blocker resolved)
- **neural-race-multiview**: Begin theorem proofs (simplified M=2, L=2 case)
- **neural-race-multiview**: Set up CIFAR experiments

## Later
*Future ideas and explorations*

- **neural-race-multiview**: Real data validation (CIFAR/ImageNet)
- **neural-race-multiview**: General proofs (arbitrary M, L)
- **neural-race-multiview**: Extensions and design principles
- Additional papers TBD
